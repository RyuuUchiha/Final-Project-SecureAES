Topic: SecureAES: Secure File Protection Using AES Encryption

Short description:
SecureAES is a Python-based tool that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256 encryption. It uses a password to generate a strong encryption key, ensuring that only authorized users can access the content. The tool features a user-friendly GUI and performs all encryption locally, keeping files safe and private without uploading them to any server.
